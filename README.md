# doom_mod_manager
A custom wrapper made in C# for the Gzdoom launcher. The sourcecode is uploaded in the same way Visual Studio saves it for convenience. The installer packaged in the main release was automatically generated by Visual Studio. Feel free to modify, or download and use. <br> I personally use this most of the time when playing Doom.<br>
This program pretty much just automates applying launch commands to Gzdoom. The program allows you to mix and match which .pk3 and .wad file you want to load via Gzdoom. The available .pk3 and .wad files are displayed in a list with checkboxes and moving a file up and down the list influences the load order. Also the program allows you to save and load different mod configurations, record a demo and even use the gzdoom lan features alongside all this.
